        "description": "NETDATA IS AN OPEN SOURCE OBSERVABILITY TOOL. IN AFFECTED VERSIONS THE `NDSUDO` TOOL SHIPPED WITH AFFECTED VERSIONS OF THE NETDATA AGENT ALLOWS AN ATTACKER TO RUN ARBITRARY PROGRAMS WITH ROOT PERMISSIONS. THE `NDSUDO` TOOL IS PACKAGED AS A `ROOT`-OWNED EXECUTABLE WITH THE SUID BIT SET. IT ONLY RUNS A RESTRICTED SET OF EXTERNAL COMMANDS, BUT ITS SEARCH PATHS ARE SUPPLIED BY THE `PATH` ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE. THIS ALLOWS AN ATTACKER TO CONTROL WHERE `NDSUDO` LOOKS FOR THESE COMMANDS, WHICH MAY BE A PATH THE ATTACKER HAS WRITE ACCESS TO. THIS MAY LEAD TO LOCAL PRIVILEGE ESCALATION. THIS VULNERABILITY HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN VERSIONS 1.45.3 AND 1.45.2-169. USERS ARE ADVISED TO UPGRADE. THERE ARE NO KNOWN WORKAROUNDS FOR THIS VULNERABILITY.",
