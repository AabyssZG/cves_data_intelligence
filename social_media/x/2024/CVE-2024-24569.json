        "description": "THE PIXEE JAVA CODE SECURITY TOOLKIT IS A SET OF SECURITY APIS MEANT TO HELP SECURE JAVA CODE. `ZIPSECURITY#ISBELOWCURRENTDIRECTORY` IS VULNERABLE TO A PARTIAL-PATH TRAVERSAL BYPASS. TO BE VULNERABLE TO THE BYPASS, THE APPLICATION MUST USE TOOLKIT VERSION <=1.1.1, USE ZIPSECURITY AS A GUARD AGAINST PATH TRAVERSAL, AND HAVE AN EXPLOIT PATH. ALTHOUGH THE CONTROL STILL PROTECTS ATTACKERS FROM ESCAPING THE APPLICATION PATH INTO HIGHER LEVEL DIRECTORIES (E.G., /ETC/), IT WILL ALLOW ESCAPING INTO SIBLING PATHS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOUR RUNNING PATH IS /MY/APP/PATH YOU AN ATTACKER COULD NAVIGATE INTO /MY/APP/PATH-SOMETHING-ELSE. THIS VULNERABILITY IS PATCHED IN 1.1.2.\n\n",
