        "description": "A USE-AFTER-FREE VULNERABILITY WAS FOUND IN THE PROCRENDERADDGLYPHS() FUNCTION OF XORG SERVERS. THIS ISSUE OCCURS WHEN ALLOCATEGLYPH() IS CALLED TO STORE NEW GLYPHS SENT BY THE CLIENT TO THE X SERVER, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN MULTIPLE ENTRIES POINTING TO THE SAME NON-REFCOUNTED GLYPHS. CONSEQUENTLY, PROCRENDERADDGLYPHS() MAY FREE A GLYPH, LEADING TO A USE-AFTER-FREE SCENARIO WHEN THE SAME GLYPH POINTER IS SUBSEQUENTLY ACCESSED. THIS FLAW ALLOWS AN AUTHENTICATED ATTACKER TO EXECUTE ARBITRARY CODE ON THE SYSTEM BY SENDING A SPECIALLY CRAFTED REQUEST.",
