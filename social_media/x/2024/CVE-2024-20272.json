THIS VULNERABILITY IS DUE TO A LACK OF AUTHENTICATION IN A SPECIFIC API AND IMPROPER VALIDATION OF USER-SUPPLIED DATA. AN ATTACKER COULD EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY BY UPLOADING ARBITRARY FILES TO AN AFFECTED SYSTEM. A SUCCESSFUL EXPLOIT COULD ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO STORE MALICIOUS FILES ON THE SYSTEM, EXECUTE ARBITRARY COMMANDS ON THE OPERATING SYSTEM, AND ELEVATE PRIVILEGES TO ROOT.",
