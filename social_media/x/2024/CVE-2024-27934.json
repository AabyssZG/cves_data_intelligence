USE OF INHERENTLY UNSAFE `*CONST C_VOID` AND `EXTERNALPOINTER` LEADS TO USE-AFTER-FREE ACCESS OF THE UNDERLYING STRUCTURE, WHICH IS EXPLOITABLE BY AN ATTACKER CONTROLLING THE CODE EXECUTED INSIDE A DENO RUNTIME TO OBTAIN ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION ON THE HOST MACHINE REGARDLESS OF PERMISSIONS. THIS BUG IS KNOWN TO BE EXPLOITABLE FOR BOTH `*CONST C_VOID` AND `EXTERNALPOINTER` IMPLEMENTATIONS. VERSION 1.40.3 FIXES THIS ISSUE.",
