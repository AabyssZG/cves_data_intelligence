THERE IS A SERVER SIDE TEMPLATE INJECTION (SSTI) IN JINJA2 THAT ALLOWS REMOTE COMMAND EXECUTION ON THE SERVER HOST. ATTACKERS CAN RUN ANY SYSTEM COMMAND WITHOUT ANY RESTRICTION AND THEY COULD USE A REVERSE SHELL. THE IMPACT IS CRITICAL AS THE ATTACKER CAN COMPLETELY TAKEOVER THE SERVER MACHINE. THIS CAN BE REDUCED IF CHANGEDETECTION IS BEHIND A LOGIN PAGE, BUT THIS ISNT REQUIRED BY THE APPLICATION (NOT BY DEFAULT AND NOT ENFORCED).",
