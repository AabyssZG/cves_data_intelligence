ADMINISTRATOR-LEVEL PRIVILEGES ARE REQUIRED TO EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY.\r\n\r THIS VULNERABILITY IS DUE TO IMPROPER VALIDATION OF A FILE WHEN IT IS READ FROM SYSTEM FLASH MEMORY. AN ATTACKER COULD EXPLOIT THIS VULNERABILITY BY COPYING A CRAFTED FILE TO THE DISK0: FILE SYSTEM OF AN AFFECTED DEVICE. A SUCCESSFUL EXPLOIT COULD ALLOW THE ATTACKER TO EXECUTE ARBITRARY CODE ON THE AFFECTED DEVICE AFTER THE NEXT RELOAD OF THE DEVICE, WHICH COULD ALTER SYSTEM BEHAVIOR. BECAUSE THE INJECTED CODE COULD PERSIST ACROSS DEVICE REBOOTS, CISCO HAS RAISED THE SECURITY IMPACT RATING (SIR) OF THIS ADVISORY FROM MEDIUM TO HIGH.",
