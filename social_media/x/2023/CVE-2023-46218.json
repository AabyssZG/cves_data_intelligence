THIS ALLOWS A SITE TO SET COOKIES THAT THEN WOULD GET SENT TO\nDIFFERENT AND UNRELATED SITES AND DOMAINS.\n\nIT COULD DO THIS BY EXPLOITING A MIXED CASE FLAW IN CURLS FUNCTION THAT\nVERIFIES A GIVEN COOKIE DOMAIN AGAINST THE PUBLIC SUFFIX LIST (PSL). FOR\nEXAMPLE A COOKIE COULD BE SET WITH `DOMAIN=CO.UK` WHEN THE URL USED A LOWER\nCASE HOSTNAME `CURL.CO.UK`, EVEN THOUGH `CO.UK` IS LISTED AS A PSL DOMAIN.\n",
