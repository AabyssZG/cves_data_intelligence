THIS STACK-PROTECTOR FAILURE ONLY APPLIES \nTO C99-STYLE DYNAMICALLY-SIZED LOCAL VARIABLES OR THOSE CREATED USING \nALLOCA(). THE STACK-PROTECTOR OPERATES AS INTENDED FOR STATICALLY-SIZED \nLOCAL VARIABLES.\n\nTHE DEFAULT BEHAVIOR WHEN THE STACK-PROTECTOR \nDETECTS AN OVERFLOW IS TO TERMINATE YOUR APPLICATION, RESULTING IN \nCONTROLLED LOSS OF AVAILABILITY. AN ATTACKER WHO CAN EXPLOIT A BUFFER \nOVERFLOW WITHOUT TRIGGERING THE STACK-PROTECTOR MIGHT BE ABLE TO CHANGE \nPROGRAM FLOW CONTROL TO CAUSE AN UNCONTROLLED LOSS OF AVAILABILITY OR TO\n GO FURTHER AND AFFECT CONFIDENTIALITY OR INTEGRITY.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
