        "description": "MYBB IS A FREE AND OPEN SOURCE FORUM SOFTWARE. CUSTOM MYCODE (BBCODE) FOR THE VISUAL EDITOR (_SCEDITOR_) DOESNT ESCAPE INPUT PROPERLY WHEN RENDERING HTML, RESULTING IN A DOM-BASED XSS VULNERABILITY. THIS WEAKNESS CAN BE EXPLOITED BY POINTING A VICTIM TO A PAGE WHERE THE VISUAL EDITOR IS ACTIVE (E.G. AS A POST OR PRIVATE MESSAGE) AND OPERATES ON A MALICIOUSLY CRAFTED MYCODE MESSAGE. THIS MAY OCCUR ON PAGES WHERE MESSAGE CONTENT IS PRE-FILLED USING A GET/POST PARAMETER, OR ON REPLY PAGES WHERE A PREVIOUSLY SAVED MALICIOUS MESSAGE IS QUOTED. THE IMPACT IS BE MITIGATED WHEN: 1. THE VISUAL EDITOR IS DISABLED GLOBALLY (_ADMIN CP \u2192 CONFIGURATION \u2192 SETTINGS \u2192 CLICKABLE SMILIES AND BB CODE: [CLICKABLE MYCODE EDITOR](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/MYBB/MYBB/BLOB/MYBB_1836/INSTALL/RESOURCES/SETTINGS.XML#L2087-L2094)_ IS SET TO _OFF_), OR 2. THE VISUAL EDITOR IS DISABLED FOR INDIVIDUAL USER ACCOUNTS (_USER CP \u2192 YOUR PROFILE \u2192 EDIT OPTIONS_: _SHOW THE MYCODE FORMATTING OPTIONS ON THE POSTING PAGES_ CHECKBOX IS NOT CHECKED). MYBB 1.8.37 RESOLVES THIS ISSUE WITH THE COMMIT `6DCAF0B4D`. USERS ARE ADVISED TO UPGRADE. USERS UNABLE TO UPGRADE MAY MITIGATE THE IMPACT WITHOUT UPGRADING MYBB BY CHANGING THE FOLLOWING SETTING (_ADMIN CP \u2192 CONFIGURATION \u2192 SETTINGS_):\n- _CLICKABLE SMILIES AND BB CODE \u2192 [CLICKABLE MYCODE EDITOR](HTTPS://GITHUB.COM/MYBB/MYBB/BLOB/MYBB_1836/INSTALL/RESOURCES/SETTINGS.XML#L2087-L2094)_: _OFF_. SIMILARLY, INDIVIDUAL MYBB FORUM USERS ARE ABLE TO DISABLE THE VISUAL EDITOR BY DIABLING THE ACCOUNT OPTION (_USER CP \u2192 YOUR PROFILE \u2192 EDIT OPTIONS_) _SHOW THE MYCODE FORMATTING OPTIONS ON THE POSTING PAGES_.",
