A USER OF THE GNOME DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT CAN BE EXPLOITED BY DOWNLOADING A CUE SHEET FROM A MALICIOUS WEBPAGE. BECAUSE THE FILE IS SAVED TO `~/DOWNLOADS`, IT IS THEN AUTOMATICALLY SCANNED BY TRACKER-MINERS. AND BECAUSE IT HAS A .CUE FILENAME EXTENSION, TRACKER-MINERS USE LIBCUE TO PARSE THE FILE. THE FILE EXPLOITS THE VULNERABILITY IN LIBCUE TO GAIN CODE EXECUTION. THIS ISSUE IS PATCHED IN VERSION 2.3.0.",
