        "description": "WORDPRESS THROUGH 4.7.4 RELIES ON THE HOST HTTP HEADER FOR A PASSWORD-RESET E-MAIL MESSAGE, WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR REMOTE ATTACKERS TO RESET ARBITRARY PASSWORDS BY MAKING A CRAFTED WP-LOGIN.PHP?ACTION=LOSTPASSWORD REQUEST AND THEN ARRANGING FOR THIS MESSAGE TO BOUNCE OR BE RESENT, LEADING TO TRANSMISSION OF THE RESET KEY TO A MAILBOX ON AN ATTACKER-CONTROLLED SMTP SERVER. THIS IS RELATED TO PROBLEMATIC USE OF THE SERVER_NAME VARIABLE IN WP-INCLUDES/PLUGGABLE.PHP IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PHP MAIL FUNCTION. EXPLOITATION IS NOT ACHIEVABLE IN ALL CASES BECAUSE IT REQUIRES AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE ATTACKER CAN PREVENT THE VICTIM FROM RECEIVING ANY E-MAIL MESSAGES FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME (SUCH AS 5 DAYS), (2) THE VICTIMS E-MAIL SYSTEM SENDS AN AUTORESPONSE CONTAINING THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE, OR (3) THE VICTIM MANUALLY COMPOSES A REPLY CONTAINING THE ORIGINAL MESSAGE.",
